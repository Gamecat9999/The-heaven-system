# 🌌 The Heaven System

**The Heaven System** is a modular RPG framework for Minecraft that overlays gameplay with stat progression, evolving titles, and divine recognition. It transforms ordinary actions into mythic feats, rewarding players with stats, prestige, and—if they’re worthy—ascension.

## 🧩 What It Does

- Tracks player stats like Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Charisma
- Awards titles for unique feats, which upgrade over time and grant stat bonuses
- Introduces **Potential**, a hidden metric of player impact
- Unlocks mythic roles:
  - 🧱 **System Mediator** – semi-divine guide with limited command access
  - 🏗️ **System Architect** – full admin role (no creative), able to shape the world
- Supports class evolution, milestone recognition, and logic-based rewards
- Features cinematic overlays and modular expansion

## 🪶 Philosophy

The Heaven System doesn’t just reward players—it watches them. It recognizes greatness, tracks impact, and turns Minecraft into a mythic proving ground. Every block broken, mob slain, and choice made is judged by the System’s cold logic and divine flair.
